# Week-Five-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler!

Work Day Scheduler created by Jeremy C. Collins. This is my week five challenge to make a Work Day Planner using Jquery/Bootstrap/Moment.js/Javascript. This planner, includes features that allow users to add tasks to complete each hour of there workday, its color coded to show upcoming tasks and overdue tasks! It will save the tasks to the localStorage, and display the schedule for the day in lines given.
